Overview and Concepts","keywords":"","body":"scilog_logo.png\nSciLog Electronic Logbook Overview\nBuild Status\nWhy SciLog ?\nSciLog supports you as a scientist to capture as much information as possible while conducting an experiment or a measurement. In particular it allows you to easily enter information about data otherwise not readily available, e.g. when you did what with what intentions. Both text and images can be added easily. All this can be done in a collaborative fashion, where several people, potentially separated by large distances, work on the same experiment. All connected users see the same status of the available information in real time. \nSciLog is meant to replace the need for a paper written logbook, while keeping the ease of use of a paper written logbook. The resulting electronic logbook is an important addition to the metadata  describing the process, which generates the resulting datasets (and which are typically stored in a separate data catalog) and adds to the overall goal of making data F.A.I.R, in particular by improving on the aspect of reproducibility (R) of the data. In contrast to paper logbooks it adds readabaility  ;-) , ease of sharing and searchability of the entered information. Furthermore it allows to reuse the information in different contexts and to export the data to other systems.\nSciLog has its sweet spot in supporting usually non-repetitive, collaborative experiments, but can as well be used in more structured or automated situations or in situations, where a single user wants to keep track of what he/she is doing. Data can be added to the logbook both manually by a human being or automatically via a command line (CLI) or REST programming interface from other processes, such as the data acquisition processes.\nImportant concepts\nSciLog clearly separates the storage of the entered data (Backend) from its representation to the user (Frontend). This has many advantages, in particular being able to adjust the representation of the data to specific use cases, while reusing a common backend of the data. \nThe Backend is implement on the basis of a document database Mongo connected to a REST-API layer based on Loopback 4.\nFrontends can be added choosing differnt GUI technologies (e.g. web based or Qt) and languages (Typescript, Python, C++). The current SciLog implementation comes with a default web based frontend implemented with Angular/Typescript as a so called responsive single page application(SPA) . In this way the GUI can be used both on a PC and on a smartphone or tablet.\nThe data is stored in a very fine grained way in so called snippets of data. Example of such snippet data are a short text or an image. The data entered into SciLog is automatically enriched with additional metadata, in particular about who and when the snippet was entered. The user can furthermore add tags to each snippet, thus improving on the searching and sorting capabilities. In this way data can be displayed in the frontend in  a structured but still flexible way. \nThe underlying document database allows to query the snippet data , using all the available metadata fields as filter and or sorting criteria. The snippets are queried in order to present them in a logical (usually time sorted) manner to the user.\nSnippets are connected via parent-child relationships. E.g. a  paragraph usually has a logboook snippet as a parent (think of this relation as a belongsTo relation, the snippet belongs to the logbook). Since logbooks are also snippets a hierarchy of logbooks can be created.\nThe database is initially filled with snippets of type location (e.g. a beamline or an instrument), describing the device that generates the data. A logbook is subsequently connected to a location at creation time. At PSI we create logbook instances automatically from the information provided in the digital uer office (DUO) system. Then the user can select from these pre-defined logbooks to enter their experiment data, i.e. opening the logbook. The user then adds further information in form of text and images to this logbook via the provided GUI(s). The connection to the respective logbooks are automatically provided by the system.\nThe following snippet types are currently supported: location (describing the beamline or instrument), logbook (containing the data snippets), paragraph (i.e. any HTMl text with Headings, tables etc), file (for attachments), image (for graphs, illustrations, photos etc), task (e.g. for todo lists)\nAll snippet types are derived from a basesnippet class, which offers common base functionality:\n\nkeeping track of when data was created/updated and when updating options will expire (timestamps)\ndefinition of access control lists (ACLs) defining who can create/read/update/delete/share and manage data\nopenAccess logic (to make images readable without need for authentication)\npre-calculate on the fly user dependent calculatedACLs (not persistently stored in DB)\nhistory handling of snippet data when snippets are updated\nhistory and optional restore logic when snippets are deleted\n\nDifferent connected users (clients) see the same status of the entered data, changes done\nby one client are automatically propagated to all connected clients\nvia a push mechanism, based on websockets and supported by the underlying Mongo DB.\nSince snippets are stored independently they can be presented in different contexts. So called virtual logbooks allow to enrich the displayed snippet data with  snippets of other logbooks by defining a query expression: all snippets from other logbooks fulfilling the query condition and to which the logged in user has read access will then be dispalyed along with the normal snippet data of this logbook. A typical use case may be, that a beamline manager wants to see all snippet data tagged with tag manager from other logbooks in the context of his beamline manager logbook, collecting information across different experiments, but conducted at the same beamline or instrument. \nIn addition to interacting via the GUI users can also interact via the REST API directly (in any language of their choice) or they can use the Python SDK offered to deal with the snippet data via a command line interface. This is especially useful to connect other processes to SciLog, such as the data acquisition processes, or to migrate data from other existing electronic logbooks.\nStructure of Documentation\nThe documentaion is split into the following chapters:\n\nUser Guide - Users of the system can come here to see screen captures, FAQs and find resources on how to better understand SciLog.\nIngestor Guide - Instrument responsibles read this to understand how data can ge ingested into SciLog either manually or in an automated fashion from external processes.\nOperator Guide - System admins read this part to set up SciLog for their institute\nDeveloper Guide - Developers who want to contribute to the project should read this chapter.\n\nTalks and Posters\n\nTODO add Poster and Klaus talk\n\n"},"Users/":{"url":"Users/","title":"User Guide","keywords":"","body":"User Manual\nThe User Manual summarizes the main functionality of the SciLog Web application by showing screenshot examples for all the parts of the application.\nThe guiding principle however for the SciLog GUI is however, that it should be as self explaining as possible, such that no (costly) learning curve needs to be invested. This is mainly achieved by a sreamlined interface and the sue of a WYSIWYG editor.\nTODO: add screenshot with tooltips\nFor actions needing likely more explanations, in particular how to add snippet data automatically to the logbook, please have a look in the Ingestor manual.\n"},"Users/Login.html":{"url":"Users/Login.html","title":"Login","keywords":"","body":"Login\nTo get access to the data, for which you have read access, you first have to login. \n\nThere are two types of account associated with SciLog: Functional and User. A functional account will primarily be used by instrument responsibles or beamline managers for automated tasks and ingests. Also the general \"admin\" user is  a functional account. Functional accounts and their passwords are stored within SciLog itself and are defined at boot tome of the application.\nIn all other cases you login with ayour personal User account. User accounts are tied into the login system that is used by your institution, for example: Active Directory or an OIDC identity provider. You are able to log in to the system using the same credentials you use on that account. This process is called authentication in IT tech terminology.\nWhen you login as a user, your user management system will assign groups (think of themn as roles) to the logged in user. These roles are the basis of authorization decisons, i.e. they define which part of the logbooks and snippet data are visible to the logged user. The logic that defines, what parts of the data you can see, is called \"authorization\" in IT terminology\n"},"Users/Dashboard.html":{"url":"Users/Dashboard.html","title":"Overview Dashboard","keywords":"","body":"Dashboard\nThe dashboard is the first page that you see after being logged in.

The following diagram shows these components and also shows potentially existing components at your site, that you would likely want to interface to SciCat. The specific diagram reflects essentially the situation at PSI as of Sept. 2020. Of course your situation may look different. The diagram should therefore be seen as an example , which you need to adapt to your situation.\n\nBackend\nAt the heart of the SciCat architecture there is the REST API server Catamel. This is a  NodeJS application that uses the Loopback 3 framework to generate RESTful APIs from JSON files that define models (such as: Users, Datasets, Instruments etc). Following the Swagger/OpenAPI format SDKs can be generated in almost any language.\nThe persistence layer behind this API server is a MongoDB instance, i.e an open source, NoSQL, document-based database solution. The API server handles alll the bi-directional communication from the REST interface to the Database.\nThese two components together comprise the \"backend\" of the architecture.\nFrontend\nTo the REST server an arbitrary number of \"clients\" (frontends) can be connected. One of the most important clients is the web based GUI frontend Catanie. This allows to communicate with the data catalog in a user friendly way. It is based on the Angular (9+) technology and uses ngrx to communicate with the SciCat API and provide a searchable interface for datasets, as well as the option to carry out actions (i.e. archiving).\nIn addition to the GUI other clients exist, such as command line (CLI) clients (example exist written in GO and Python) or desktop based GUI applications based on Qt. The CLI tools are especially useful for automated workflows, e.g. to get the data into the data catalog. This process is termed \"ingestion\" of the data. But they can also be used to add the data manually, especially for derived data, since this part of the workflow is often not possible to automate, in particular in truly experimental setups.\nMessaging infrastructure\nAs a way to loosely couple external systems the API server can be connected to messaging system. In particular RabbitMQ (used at PSI) and Apache Kafka are in use. Such systems can e.g. be used to interface to an tape archive system. To add the specific business logic you can e.g. add your own scripting layer. At PSI however a Node-RED  based solution proofed to be a stable and flexible platform for this purpose. Node-RED is a A NodeJS based visual programming tool to handle flows of data from one source to another. The following shows the Nod-RED flow used for communicating job requests to the PSI archive system\n\nPublishing Server\nIn order to publish data you need to run a landing page server and you need to assign DOIs to your published data. Since the API server may be operated in an intranet, with no access to the internet the following architecture was chosen at PSI:\nAn OAI-PMH server is running in a DMZ connected to a local Mongo instance. At publication time the data from SciCat is pushed to the external OAI-PMH server.\nFrom this server the landing page server can fetch the information about the published data. Also external DOI systems connect to this OAI-PMH server to synchronize the data with the world wide DOI system. \nIf a user wants to download the full datasets of the published data, the data is copied from the internal file server to a https file server (acting as a cache file server) , which subsequently allows anaonymous download of the data\nChat Server as electronic logbook\nTODO ESS\nExternal systems\nThe most important external system, that you want to connect to is likely your local identity management (IDM) system, e.g. an LDAP or AD based solution. This is usually the source of both the authentication and the authorization information, the latter being realized by simple group membership of the users.\nAnother important external system, that you may want to connect, is your local proposal handling system (such as DUO at PSI). This defines, which user is allowed to measure at what instrument or beamline at what time. If you do not have such a system you can fill the Proposal Information also by hand, or just leave it empty. If you have such a system you need to write scripts which synchronize the data in these systems with the corresponding tables in the SciCat Database, i.e. the Proposal collection\nFinally external storage systems, in particular those dealing with storage on tape, are a good candidate of an external system\nFile servers are another component that you may want to integrate. The SciCat architecture does not require any such connection to the file contents, since it deals with metadata only. However the GUI can link to storage systems, which offer to download data using the https protocol.\nUnderlying Infrastructure\nYou may or may not run the infrastructure as part of a Kubernetes cluster. E.g. at PSI the API server, the GUI application, RabbitMQ and the Node-RED instances are all deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, whereas the Mongo DB ist kept outside Kubernetes.\nKubernetes is not necessary to have, but can simplify your life quite a bit. Also the separation into internet and intranet zones is up to you to define. You can of course operate the whole infrastructure directly in internet accessible servers, if your security policies permit.\n"},"Operator/Step_by_Step_Setup.html":{"url":"Operator/Step_by_Step_Setup.html","title":"Step by Step instruction","keywords":"","body":"Step by Step instruction\n"},"Operator/Step_by_Step_Setup_Docker.html":{"url":"Operator/Step_by_Step_Setup_Docker.html","title":"Deploy with Docker Compose","keywords":"","body":"Setup SciCat with Docker Compose\nThe scicatlive repo defines a quick and convenient method for getting started.

For the schema just follow the Schema link at Basesnippet description\nIt describes the fields that each snippet type will have, like date, ownership and history related information. Also the relation to a parent snippet is defined here.\nMany other models are derived from this model. Derived models define the type via the snippetType field value\nLocation\nDescribes a location of an activity like a measurement and is usually a description of a beammline or instrument together with some thumbnail image .\nLogbook\nEach logboook is defined as snippet type logbook .
